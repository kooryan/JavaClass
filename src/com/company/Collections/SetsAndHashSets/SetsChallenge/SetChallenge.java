       Test cases:
       1. The planets and moons that we added in the previous video should appear in
       the solarSystem collection and in the sets of moons for the appropriate planets.

       2. a.equals(b) must return the same result as b.equals(a) - equals is symmetric.

       3. Attempting to add a duplicate to a Set must result in no change to the set (so
       the original value is not replaced by the new one).

       4. Attempting to add a duplicate to a Map results in the original being replaced
       by the new object.

       5. Two bodies with the same name but different designations can be added to the same set.

       6. Two bodies with the same name but different designations can be added to the same map,
       and can be retrieved from the map.
